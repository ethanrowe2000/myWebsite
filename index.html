                    <p>Priorities involve developing applications in C++ to manipulate database records through a GUI. Furthermore, I create Python and PowerShell scripts to automate processes such as generating reports, emailing said reports, AD management, encryption and file sharing, transfer, uploads to SFTP site, and much more. Some of this includes migrating older visual basic scripts into a more modern solution. Also, I create and maintain up-to-date windows images for a variety of computers to deploy, including optional installs for many different applications. More importantly, I identify areas of improvement within our main location and remote sites. This means leading projects to implement new systems, rollout major changes, such as integrating new locations into our network, and migrating to new systems from legacy systems.</p>

Additional daily responsibilities included performing the NOC process before production hours to ensure all 51 locations in the lower 48 states - including our manufacturing facilities and thousands of employees - were online and functional. During this thorough NOC process, I regularly updated with new monitoring systems and improved regularly to maximize uptime and prevent any avoidable production issues. Any issues found during the NOC I would address as level 1 and 2 support, and escalate when necessary. Other responsibilities include administering any and all technical equipment upgrades/maintenance on site, handling production calls, and helping in person with technical issues regarding computers, printers, a wide range of scanners, TVs, and much more. Occasional responsibilities include in-person support by long-distance traveling to facilities out of state, along with preparing, assisting, and occasionally hosting quarterly and yearly presentations for CEOs/managers. </p>

                <p>Summary:</p> 
                </div>
                <p>Started out disassembling 6L80/90 2WD and 4WD GM transmissions. This process took approximately 20 minutes including breakdown and washing. The process started by tagging a unit into our proprietary software application for record keeping. After that, the unit was torn down completely, and any broken or unusable parts were discarded. The main priority was to check all components and verify that parts were within spec. After tearing down all parts  - excluding gaskets and clutch plates - are washed in 150 solvent before going in a commercial washer. 
                    After 4 months of performing disassembly, I partook in a workshop, whose main aim was to completely restructure the disassembly production process for my disassembly area. After providing invaluable insight, details, timings, and instructions while working closely with auditors, we were able to streamline and improve drastically the output of the production process for the whole department. 
                    Shortly after this, I trained in assembly of the same transmission, 6L80/90 2W and 4WD transmissions. I also underwent a very similar process while training to completely restructure the remanufacturing process of these transmissions. 
                    Approximately in October 2021 while on light duty from surgery on my right knee, over two months I performed daily timings and completely rewrote work instructions for every process in the transmission department, from the converter area, to each POD responsible for all makes and models of transmissions. Through this rework I updated these instructions by correcting and improving the data, verifying and ensuring all details and recordings of the processes were correct and accurate. 
                    My last position while in Transmissions was in JCC. I was responsible for the teardown, inspection, and circulation of all salvageable parts of every transmission in the facility to support production inventory. This made sure that parts that were no longer available on the market would still be available to us if needed for the remanufacturing process.  </p>

Furthermore, setting up weighing instruments to ensure each bag has the correct weight, and checking/testing the pressurized nitrogen system to ensure shelf life. Additionally, UPC and barcodes needed set accordingly for each run as well. I worked closely with the equipment which needed completely adjusted mechanically and with custom computer systems since no run was the same. I prioritized uptime and minimized downtime through efficiency and urgency in response time and support. 
                    Another daily responsibility was to lead a team of people in a way that maximized production based on each person's strengths. This meant communicating and planning with management when short-staffed, and who is located where. Leadership was relatively hands-off, and responsibility fell on the line lead to verify lines were staffed appropriately. </p>
